•	What problems you encountered completing the assignment and how you overcame them  
Ran the first test and it wasn’t giving me the right counts and I ran it several times and it was working properly, displaying the right count of words

•	Any problems you weren't able to overcome or any bugs still left in the program  
No problems

•	About how long it took you to complete the assignment  
Several days but adding the time it was like 7 hours minimum

•	Performance measurements (given in seconds) for 1, 2, 4, and 8 threads  
Thread Time 
 1     1.7238   
 2     1.7955    
 4     0.9898    
 8     1.1363    

•	A short analysis of why the program behaves as it does with an increasing number of threads  
Based on the times that I ran, and I ran it a few times it all varies, it was never constant. And no matter how many threads it had it still varied, sometimes 4 threads was faster than 8. Might be because of the time function that I used?

•	Any observations or comments you had while doing the assignment  
Sometimes the times of the execution depending on the threads weren’t consistent
